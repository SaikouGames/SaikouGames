- Heyo, I'm Gabu and I'm the founder of my own game studio, @SaikouGames, which will probably have its name changed into Gabu Studios in the near future.
- I make games, and I'd like to start create apps using native languages rather than using softwares like Unity. For the moment, I don't have projects to show.
- I learnt Python and C# (with Unity), and I'm currently learning Rust ðŸ¦€.
- If you wanna contact me, you can using one of these two emails: gabuuu.music@gmail.com or contact.gabu.studios@gmail.com
