- Heyo, I'm Gabu.
- I make games. I used Unity for a long time, and I'm now learning Bevy. I'd also like to start creating apps using low level languages. For the moment, I don't have any project to show.
- I learnt Python and C# (with Unity), and I'm currently learning Rust 🦀.
- If you wanna contact me, you can using one of these two emails: gabuuu.music@gmail.com or contact.gabu.studios@gmail.com
